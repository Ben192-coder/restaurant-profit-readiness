Mix\n\nMenus do more than list food.\n\nThey direct behavior.\n\nEvery item on a menu influences:\n\nwhat guests choose\n\nhow much they spend\n\nhow long they stay\n\nhow difficult service becomes\n\nMenu engineering is the practice of designing those influences intentionally.\n\nPopularity and Profitability Are Not the Same\n\nA dish can be:\n\npopular and profitable\n\npopular and unprofitable\n\nunpopular and profitable\n\nunpopular and unprofitable\n\nMost restaurants only look at sales volume.\n\nThat hides the real story.\n\nUnderstanding product mix requires tracking both:\n\nhow often an item sells\n\nhow much it contributes\n\nWithout both, decisions are guesses.\n\nThe Four-Quadrant Model\n\nA simple way to visualize menu performance is a two-axis chart:\n\nX-axis: Profitability\n\nY-axis: Popularity\n\nThis creates four categories:\n\nStars — high popularity, high profitability\n\nWorkhorses — high popularity, low profitability\n\nPuzzles — low popularity, high profitability\n\nDogs — low popularity, low profitability\n\nThe goal is not to eliminate categories.\n\nIt is to manage them intentionally.\n\nStars: Protect Them\n\nStars:\n\ndefine the restaurant\n\ndrive guest satisfaction\n\nsupport margins\n\nThey deserve:\n\nprotection from shortcuts\n\nconsistent execution\n\nvisibility on the menu\n\nDo not overcomplicate stars.\nDo not tinker casually.\n\nThey are doing their job.\n\nWorkhorses: Control Them\n\nWorkhorses sell well but contribute less.\n\nThey:\n\nanchor the menu\n\nmeet expectations\n\ncreate traffic\n\nThese items require:\n\nstrict portion control\n\ncost discipline\n\ncareful upsell strategy\n\nWorkhorses often fund everything else.\n\nTreat them with respect.\n\nPuzzles: Fix or Feature\n\nPuzzles make money but don’t sell.\n\nThis usually means:\n\nthe name is unclear\n\nthe description misses the point\n\nthe placement is wrong\n\nservers don’t believe in it\n\nBefore removing a puzzle, try:\n\nrepositioning\n\nrenaming\n\nfeaturing as a special\n\ntraining staff to recommend it\n\nIf it still doesn’t move, it doesn’t belong.\n\nDogs: Replace Thoughtfully\n\nDogs drain attention and resources.\n\nThey:\n\nslow service\n\ncomplicate prep\n\nadd cognitive load\n\nRemoving a dog is not failure.\n\nBut replacement matters.\n\nWhat does it displace?\nWhat behavior does it change?\n\nSubstitution Effects Matter\n\nMenus don’t exist in isolation.\n\nAdding a new item always replaces something in the guest’s decision.\n\nKey question:\n\nWhat would the guest have ordered instead?\n\nIf a new special:\n\nreplaces a low-margin item → good\n\nreplaces a high-margin item → dangerous\n\nSpecials must be evaluated not just on sales—but on what they cannibalize.\n\nSpecials as Market Tests\n\nSpecials are powerful because they:\n\ntest demand\n\ncreate urgency\n\nallow experimentation\n\ngenerate excitement\n\nThey are controlled A/B tests.\n\nUse them to answer questions like:\n\nDo guests want this flavor?\n\nWill they pay this price?\n\nDoes this replace or add?\n\nData from specials should inform menu decisions—not disappear after the weekend.\n\nScarcity Creates Devotion\n\nSome items work best because they are not always available.\n\nLimited-time offerings:\n\nfeel special\n\ncreate
