People attend out of obligation, not usefulness. Nothing meaningfully changes afterward.\n\nThat’s not a meeting problem.\nThat’s a design problem.\n\nMeetings are not communication tools.\nThey are operating systems.\n\nWhy Meetings Exist\n\nA restaurant should only meet for two reasons:\n\nTo solve a problem once\n\nTo create a reason for guests to show up\n\nIf a meeting does not clearly serve one of those purposes, it should not exist.\n\nEverything else—updates, announcements, reminders—can be handled without pulling people off the floor.\n\nProblem-Focused Meetings: Solve It Once\n\nProblem-focused meetings exist to eliminate recurring issues.\n\nThey are not about blame.\nThey are about design.\n\nA real problem-focused meeting answers three questions:\n\nWhat actually happened?\n\nWhy was the system vulnerable?\n\nWhat change prevents this from happening again?\n\nIf the same issue appears week after week, the meeting failed.\n\nWhat Belongs in a Problem-Focused Meeting\n\nExamples:\n\nrepeated ticket-time blowups\n\nrecurring comp situations\n\nprep failures\n\ninventory surprises\n\nservice breakdowns\n\nguest confusion\n\nThese are not people problems.\nThey are signals.\n\nThe goal is to convert signals into:\n\nclearer standards\n\nbetter tools\n\nimproved SOPs\n\nOnce the fix is made, the problem leaves the meeting agenda permanently.\n\nEvent-Focused Meetings: Create Demand\n\nRestaurants do not survive on operations alone.\n\nThey survive on reasons for people to come in now, not someday.\n\nEvent-focused meetings exist to create those reasons.\n\nExamples:\n\nholidays that fall on slow days\n\ncultural moments\n\nseasonal shifts\n\nlimited-time offerings\n\ncommunity hooks\n\nA Tuesday holiday is not a liability.\nIt is an opportunity—if it is designed.\n\nEvents Are Not Gimmicks\n\nGood events are not desperate promotions.\n\nThey are:\n\nintentional\n\nthemed\n\nlimited\n\neasy to execute\n\nThey often combine:\n\nfixed or simplified menus\n\nfocused drink offerings\n\ncontrolled specials\n\nvisual elements\n\nclear storytelling\n\nScarcity matters.\nClarity matters more.\n\nThe Pre-Shift Meeting\n\nThe pre-shift meeting is not a lecture.\n\nIt is a reset.\n\nIts job is to answer:\n\nWhat matters tonight?\n\nWhat is different?\n\nWhere should attention go?\n\nWhat success looks like?\n\nPre-shifts should be:\n\nbrief\n\nfocused\n\nconsistent\n\nIf a pre-shift runs long, it failed.\n\nThe Post-Shift Debrief\n\nPost-shifts are optional—but powerful when used correctly.\n\nThey are not for venting.\nThey are for capturing signals.\n\nGood post-shift questions include:\n\nWhat surprised us?\n\nWhat slowed us down?\n\nWhat confused guests?\n\nWhat worked unusually well?\n\nNot every answer needs action.\nPatterns do.\n\nWeekly Management Meetings\n\nWeekly management meetings exist to:\n\nreview patterns\n\nassess metrics\n\ndecide system changes\n\nThey are where:\n\nSOPs are updated\n\nstandards are refined\n\nroles are clarified\n\nevents are planned\n\nThey are not for:\n\nrehashing the shift\n\nrelitigating conflict\n\nemotional processing\n\nIf emotion dominates, structure is missing.\n\nNo Finger-Pointing Rule\n\nMeetings fail when they become personal.\n\nA simple rule prevents this:\n\nWe fix systems, not people.\n\nThis does not excuse poor performance.\nIt ensures that fixes actually work.\n\nBlame creates defensiveness.\nDefensiveness prevents learning.\n\nLearning is the point.\n\nTurning Meetings Into Action\n\nA meeting without output is wasted time.\n\nEvery meeting should produce one or more of:\n\na clarified standard\n\na revised SOP\n\na new tool\n\na scheduled event\n\na decision owner\n\nIf nothing changes afterward, the meeting was unnecessary.\n\nFewer Meetings, Better Meetings\n\nStrong restaurants do not meet more.\n\nThey meet better.\n\nThey use meetings to:\n\nreduce future meetings\n\neliminate recurring problems\n\nalign execution\n\ncreate momentum\n\nOver time, the operation becomes quieter—not louder.\n\nThat is the sign of a healthy system.\n\nMeetings Protect Calm\n\nWell-designed meetings move chaos out of service and into planning.\n\nThey protect:\n\nfocus during shifts\n\nemotional energy\n\nexecution quality\n\nWhen meetings work, service feels easier.\n\nAnd when service feels easier,
