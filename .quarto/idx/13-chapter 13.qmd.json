Loop\n\nRestaurants lose control slowly.\n\nNot in dramatic failures—but in small, invisible gaps between what was sold, what was prepared, and what was actually used.\n\nThis chapter is about closing those gaps daily, without relying on constant full inventories or guesswork.\n\nThe end-of-shift control loop connects:\n\nwhat happened tonight\n\nwhat must be prepared tomorrow\n\nwhat needs to be ordered next\n\nWhen this loop is tight, the operation runs predictably.\nWhen it’s loose, costs drift and trust erodes.\n\nWhy Inventories Fail as a Primary Tool\n\nFull inventories are expensive, disruptive, and often inaccurate.\n\nThey:\n\nrely on tired people counting late\n\nhappen too infrequently to prevent drift\n\ncreate lag between problem and discovery\n\nencourage short-term “cleanup” behavior\n\nInventories are useful for audits.\nThey are terrible as a daily control mechanism.\n\nStrong restaurants control food before inventory becomes necessary.\n\nThe Shift Report Is the Anchor\n\nThe end-of-shift report is not paperwork.\n\nIt is the operational memory of the restaurant.\n\nA real shift report captures:\n\nwhat was sold\n\nwhat ran out\n\nwhat was prepped\n\nwhat was wasted\n\nwhat was substituted\n\nwhat surprised the team\n\nIf it didn’t make it into the report, it doesn’t exist.\n\nManagers Own the Report\n\nShift reports must be compiled by a manager or sous chef.\n\nNot delegated.\nNot assumed.\n\nLine cooks participate by:\n\ncounting\n\nshowing\n\nconfirming\n\nBut they do not decide prep levels or pars.\n\nThis separation matters.\n\nCooks execute prep.\nChefs decide prep.\nManagers confirm reality.\n\nBlurring these roles creates bias and blind spots.\n\nCounting Is Not Accusation\n\nCounts are not about catching people.\n\nThey are about maintaining alignment between:\n\nprojections\n\nexecution\n\nreality\n\nWhen counting is calm and routine, it stops feeling personal.\n\nWhen it is rare or emotional, it feels accusatory.\n\nConsistency removes tension.\n\nFrom Sales to Prep Lists\n\nThe control loop works in one direction:\n\nSales data shows demand\n\nShift report shows what actually happened\n\nPrep lists reflect tomorrow’s needs\n\nOrder lists reflect upcoming demand\n\nEach step feeds the next.\n\nWhen prep lists are guesses, ordering becomes defensive.\nWhen prep lists are informed, ordering
