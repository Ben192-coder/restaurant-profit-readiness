Chapter 9 — Meetings as Operating Systems

Most restaurants have meetings.

Very few use them well.

Meetings drift into status updates, venting sessions, or forced rituals. People attend out of obligation, not usefulness. Nothing meaningfully changes afterward.

That’s not a meeting problem.
That’s a design problem.

Meetings are not communication tools.
They are operating systems.

Why Meetings Exist

A restaurant should only meet for two reasons:

To solve a problem once

To create a reason for guests to show up

If a meeting does not clearly serve one of those purposes, it should not exist.

Everything else—updates, announcements, reminders—can be handled without pulling people off the floor.

Problem-Focused Meetings: Solve It Once

Problem-focused meetings exist to eliminate recurring issues.

They are not about blame.
They are about design.

A real problem-focused meeting answers three questions:

What actually happened?

Why was the system vulnerable?

What change prevents this from happening again?

If the same issue appears week after week, the meeting failed.

What Belongs in a Problem-Focused Meeting

Examples:

repeated ticket-time blowups

recurring comp situations

prep failures

inventory surprises

service breakdowns

guest confusion

These are not people problems.
They are signals.

The goal is to convert signals into:

clearer standards

better tools

improved SOPs

Once the fix is made, the problem leaves the meeting agenda permanently.

Event-Focused Meetings: Create Demand

Restaurants do not survive on operations alone.

They survive on reasons for people to come in now, not someday.

Event-focused meetings exist to create those reasons.

Examples:

holidays that fall on slow days

cultural moments

seasonal shifts

limited-time offerings

community hooks

A Tuesday holiday is not a liability.
It is an opportunity—if it is designed.

Events Are Not Gimmicks

Good events are not desperate promotions.

They are:

intentional

themed

limited

easy to execute

They often combine:

fixed or simplified menus

focused drink offerings

controlled specials

visual elements

clear storytelling

Scarcity matters.
Clarity matters more.

The Pre-Shift Meeting

The pre-shift meeting is not a lecture.

It is a reset.

Its job is to answer:

What matters tonight?

What is different?

Where should attention go?

What success looks like?

Pre-shifts should be:

brief

focused

consistent

If a pre-shift runs long, it failed.

The Post-Shift Debrief

Post-shifts are optional—but powerful when used correctly.

They are not for venting.
They are for capturing signals.

Good post-shift questions include:

What surprised us?

What slowed us down?

What confused guests?

What worked unusually well?

Not every answer needs action.
Patterns do.

Weekly Management Meetings

Weekly management meetings exist to:

review patterns

assess metrics

decide system changes

They are where:

SOPs are updated

standards are refined

roles are clarified

events are planned

They are not for:

rehashing the shift

relitigating conflict

emotional processing

If emotion dominates, structure is missing.

No Finger-Pointing Rule

Meetings fail when they become personal.

A simple rule prevents this:

We fix systems, not people.

This does not excuse poor performance.
It ensures that fixes actually work.

Blame creates defensiveness.
Defensiveness prevents learning.

Learning is the point.

Turning Meetings Into Action

A meeting without output is wasted time.

Every meeting should produce one or more of:

a clarified standard

a revised SOP

a new tool

a scheduled event

a decision owner

If nothing changes afterward, the meeting was unnecessary.

Fewer Meetings, Better Meetings

Strong restaurants do not meet more.

They meet better.

They use meetings to:

reduce future meetings

eliminate recurring problems

align execution

create momentum

Over time, the operation becomes quieter—not louder.

That is the sign of a healthy system.

Meetings Protect Calm

Well-designed meetings move chaos out of service and into planning.

They protect:

focus during shifts

emotional energy

execution quality

When meetings work, service feels easier.

And when service feels easier, everything improves.
