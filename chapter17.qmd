Chapter 17 — Marketing, Visibility, and Measuring What Works

Most restaurants do not have a marketing problem.

They have a measurement problem.

Money is spent. Posts are made. Ads are run. Something seems to happen—or not. Then everyone moves on without knowing why.

Marketing feels mysterious because it is rarely tied to behavior, outcomes, or systems.

This chapter is about removing the mystery.

Marketing Is Demand Engineering

Marketing is not branding.
It is not creativity.
It is not social media activity.

Marketing exists to answer one question:

Did this create the kind of guest we want, behaving the way we need?

If the answer is unclear, the marketing failed—regardless of likes, impressions, or reach.

Visibility Comes Before Persuasion

Most guests are not choosing between restaurants.

They are choosing between:

the first few options they see

what feels easy

what feels familiar

Visibility matters more than persuasion.

This is why:

“near me” searches dominate

paid listings outperform organic ones

convenience beats storytelling

If you are not visible at the moment of decision, nothing else matters.

The Modern Discovery Funnel

Most restaurant discovery follows this path:

Search or scroll

Quick visual scan

Menu glance

Price gut-check

Decision

This entire process can take under 30 seconds.

Marketing that assumes attention will fail.

Marketing that respects speed will win.

Paid vs. Organic Is a False Debate

Paid and organic serve different purposes.

Paid creates immediate visibility

Organic builds familiarity and trust over time

The question is not which to use.

The question is:

What behavior is this meant to change?

If you can’t answer that, don’t spend the money.

Promotions Without Measurement Are Discounts

Running a promotion without tracking impact is not marketing.

It is a guess.

Every promotion should be tied to:

a time window

a behavioral goal

a measurable outcome

Examples:

increased dessert penetration

increased weekday traffic

increased takeout conversion

trial of a new item

If you can’t measure it, you can’t learn from it.

Events Are Marketing With Structure

Events work because they:

create urgency

provide a reason to act

concentrate demand

Good events are:

intentional

limited

simple to explain

easy to execute

Bad events are vague, overcomplicated, or constant.

Scarcity creates devotion.
Repetition creates fatigue.

Measuring What Matters

Marketing should be evaluated using operational metrics—not vanity metrics.

What matters:

covers

mix

average spend

add-on behavior

repeat visits

channel shift (platform → direct)

What doesn’t matter on its own:

likes

impressions

follower count

Attention without conversion is noise.

Attribution Doesn’t Have to Be Perfect

Restaurants often avoid measurement because attribution isn’t perfect.

Perfect attribution is not required.

Directional clarity is enough.

Questions like:

“Did Tuesdays improve after this?”

“Did dessert sales rise during this period?”

“Did direct orders increase?”

Are more valuable than precise credit assignment.

Marketing Is a Feedback Loop

Strong marketing feeds operations.

Operations feed marketing.

Examples:

a successful special becomes a featured campaign

strong dessert performance becomes a visual push

a slow day becomes an event opportunity

When marketing is disconnected from operations, both suffer.

Data Removes Emotion From Marketing

Without data:

marketing feels personal

decisions feel political

failure feels embarrassing

With data:

experiments feel safe

failure becomes learning

success is repeatable

Marketing becomes calm.

Calm marketing is effective marketing.

Marketing Should Attract Aligned Guests

This matters:

Marketing does not just attract volume.
It attracts behavior.

Your messaging determines:

expectations

pace

price tolerance

experience alignment

Marketing that attracts the wrong guests increases friction everywhere else.

The goal is not more guests.

It is more of the right guests.

Marketing Is Not Separate From the System

Marketing is not a department.

It is an extension of:

customer engineering

menu engineering

service design

profit triggers

When aligned, marketing amplifies everything.

When misaligned, it creates chaos the operation must absorb.

The Question Marketing Must Answer

At the end of every campaign, post, ad, or event, one question matters:

Did this make the business easier to run—or harder?

If it made it easier, do it again.
If it made it harder, fix the system before repeating it.

That is how marketing becomes an asset instead of a gamble.
