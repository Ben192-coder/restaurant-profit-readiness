Chapter 19 — Incentives, Accountability, and Reinforcement

People do what is rewarded.

They also do what is tolerated.

Restaurants often get this backwards.

This chapter is about reinforcing the right behavior without creating resentment, competition, or perverse incentives.

Incentives Shape Behavior — Always

Even when you think you don’t have incentives, you do.

Examples:

praising speed over accuracy

comping without explanation

ignoring waste

tolerating shortcuts

These all reward something.

The question is whether you intended to.

FOH Incentives: Behavior, Not Volume

FOH incentives should reward:

add-on behavior

dessert introductions

aligned pacing

guest trust

They should not reward:

aggressive upselling

pressure

check manipulation

The best incentives feel like recognition, not commissions.

BOH Incentives: Respect the Invisible Work

Kitchen incentives should never be announced in front of cooks while rewarding FOH only.

That creates poison instantly.

BOH incentives can include:

ticket-time consistency

waste reduction

cleanliness and labeling

accurate end-of-shift reporting

These reward discipline—not speed alone.

Chef Specials as Incentive Vehicles

Specials are powerful:

they test the market

they drive excitement

they justify prep labor

When specials succeed, cooks should benefit.

This ties creativity to outcomes—not ego.

Accountability Without Fear

Accountability fails when it feels arbitrary.

It works when:

expectations are clear

metrics are visible

consequences are consistent

Fear-based accountability creates:

hiding

blaming

shortcuts

Visibility-based accountability creates ownership.

Perfect Guests Should Be Rewarded Too

Aligned guests matter.

Guests who:

trust recommendations

respect staff

return regularly

Should feel recognized.

Not with discounts—but with:

memory

access

subtle priority

This reinforces the behavior you want more of.

Incentives Must Be Sustainable

If an incentive:

erodes margins

requires constant escalation

trains entitlement

It will fail.

Incentives should reinforce systems—not replace them.
