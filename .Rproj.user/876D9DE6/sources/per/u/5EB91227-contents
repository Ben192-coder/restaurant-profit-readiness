## Restaurant Profit Readiness Guide

This guide is designed for restaurant owners and operators who want clear, practical control over profitability — without guesswork.

Inside, you’ll learn how to: - Understand true daily break-even - Control labor based on real sales patterns - Identify food cost leakage - Find the exact point where profit accelerates - Make confident, data-driven decisions

This guide pairs with the **Restaurant Profit Readiness Check** and is intended to be practical, not theoretical.

Use it as: - A diagnostic companion - A training reference - A decision-making framework
