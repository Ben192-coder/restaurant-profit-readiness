Chapter 14 — Menu Engineering and Product Mix

Menus do more than list food.

They direct behavior.

Every item on a menu influences:

what guests choose

how much they spend

how long they stay

how difficult service becomes

Menu engineering is the practice of designing those influences intentionally.

Popularity and Profitability Are Not the Same

A dish can be:

popular and profitable

popular and unprofitable

unpopular and profitable

unpopular and unprofitable

Most restaurants only look at sales volume.

That hides the real story.

Understanding product mix requires tracking both:

how often an item sells

how much it contributes

Without both, decisions are guesses.

The Four-Quadrant Model

A simple way to visualize menu performance is a two-axis chart:

X-axis: Profitability

Y-axis: Popularity

This creates four categories:

Stars — high popularity, high profitability

Workhorses — high popularity, low profitability

Puzzles — low popularity, high profitability

Dogs — low popularity, low profitability

The goal is not to eliminate categories.

It is to manage them intentionally.

Stars: Protect Them

Stars:

define the restaurant

drive guest satisfaction

support margins

They deserve:

protection from shortcuts

consistent execution

visibility on the menu

Do not overcomplicate stars.
Do not tinker casually.

They are doing their job.

Workhorses: Control Them

Workhorses sell well but contribute less.

They:

anchor the menu

meet expectations

create traffic

These items require:

strict portion control

cost discipline

careful upsell strategy

Workhorses often fund everything else.

Treat them with respect.

Puzzles: Fix or Feature

Puzzles make money but don’t sell.

This usually means:

the name is unclear

the description misses the point

the placement is wrong

servers don’t believe in it

Before removing a puzzle, try:

repositioning

renaming

featuring as a special

training staff to recommend it

If it still doesn’t move, it doesn’t belong.

Dogs: Replace Thoughtfully

Dogs drain attention and resources.

They:

slow service

complicate prep

add cognitive load

Removing a dog is not failure.

But replacement matters.

What does it displace?
What behavior does it change?

Substitution Effects Matter

Menus don’t exist in isolation.

Adding a new item always replaces something in the guest’s decision.

Key question:

What would the guest have ordered instead?

If a new special:

replaces a low-margin item → good

replaces a high-margin item → dangerous

Specials must be evaluated not just on sales—but on what they cannibalize.

Specials as Market Tests

Specials are powerful because they:

test demand

create urgency

allow experimentation

generate excitement

They are controlled A/B tests.

Use them to answer questions like:

Do guests want this flavor?

Will they pay this price?

Does this replace or add?

Data from specials should inform menu decisions—not disappear after the weekend.

Scarcity Creates Devotion

Some items work best because they are not always available.

Limited-time offerings:

feel special

create anticipation

drive repeat visits

An item that sells 150 units in one day as a special may lose impact as a permanent menu item.

Scarcity is not manipulation.

It is focus.

Product Mix and Labor

Menu engineering also affects labor.

Items vary in:

prep complexity

station load

execution risk

A profitable item that breaks the kitchen during volume is not truly profitable.

Menu design must consider:

throughput

bottlenecks

training load

Profit without flow is fragile.

The Dessert Effect

Dessert is unique.

When core items cover fixed costs, dessert often represents disproportionate profit.

Dessert sales:

accelerate profit

extend the experience

increase average spend

Tracking dessert mix over time reveals more than average check alone.

Dessert is not just a menu section.

It is a strategy.

Data Makes Menu Decisions Calm

Menu changes are emotional without data.

With data:

debates end

decisions feel fair

experiments are intentional

Menu engineering turns intuition into insight.

And insight into profit.
