Chapter 18 — Hiring, Training, and Developing Talent

Restaurants often say they are short-staffed.

What they usually mean is they are short on alignment.

Hiring is not about filling positions.
It is about protecting systems.

This chapter is about why training new people is easier than untraining bad habits—and how to build teams that reinforce standards instead of resisting them.

Experience Is Overrated

Experience looks attractive on paper.

In practice, experience often means:

habits formed elsewhere

standards learned in different systems

shortcuts normalized under pressure

Untraining is harder than training.

This is especially true in the kitchen.

BOH: Develop, Don’t Rewire

Back-of-house roles reward:

consistency

discipline

repetition

respect for standards

Line cooks with deeply ingrained habits often struggle when asked to:

measure instead of eyeball

plate to spec

follow motion standards

Newer cooks, properly trained, often outperform veterans because they:

learn one system

internalize standards early

don’t fight correction

For BOH, teachability beats experience.

FOH: Experience Matters — But Alignment Matters More

Front-of-house is different.

Service requires:

emotional intelligence

confidence

timing

situational awareness

Some of this only comes from experience.

But experience without alignment creates problems:

overselling

freelancing

boundary erosion

FOH hires should be evaluated on:

how they guide decisions

how they respond to structure

how they handle boundaries

Not just charisma.

Interviewing for Alignment

Good interviews don’t sell the job.

They reveal thinking.

Questions should surface:

how candidates handle standards

how they react to correction

how they define good service

whether they see service as guidance or performance

The goal is not agreement.

The goal is compatibility.

Training Is System Introduction

Training is not information transfer.

It is system immersion.

Effective training:

shows what “right” looks like

explains why it matters

removes ambiguity

sets expectations early

If training feels vague, standards will be vague.

Early Correction Is Kindness

Most training failures come from delayed correction.

Letting things slide early teaches:

standards are flexible

correction is personal

feedback is optional

Early, calm correction:

builds confidence

prevents resentment

protects culture

Correction is not punishment.

It is clarity.

Peer Reinforcement Matters

Strong teams teach each other.

Not through hazing or dominance—but through survival.

When:

coworkers quietly help new staff

standards are reinforced casually

mistakes are corrected without drama

Culture stabilizes.

When teasing, exclusion, or “sink or swim” behavior appears, turnover follows.

Turnover kills systems.

Training Never Ends — But It Evolves

Training does not stop after onboarding.

It shifts to:

refinement

reinforcement

adaptation

As systems improve, training updates.

Static training produces drift.

Hiring Is a Strategic Function

Hiring decisions shape:

guest experience

food cost

labor cost

management workload

Hiring the wrong person creates work for everyone else.

Hiring fewer, better-aligned people makes the restaurant calmer.
